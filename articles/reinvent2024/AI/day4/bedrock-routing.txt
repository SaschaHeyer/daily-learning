Amazon Bedrock Intelligent Prompt Routing – When invoking a model, you can now use a combination of foundation models (FMs) from the same model family to help optimize for quality and cost. For example, with the Anthropic’s Claude model family, Amazon Bedrock can intelligently route requests between Claude 3.5 Sonnet and Claude 3 Haiku depending on the complexity of the prompt. Similarly, Amazon Bedrock can route requests between Meta Llama 3.1 70B and 8B. The prompt router predicts which model will provide the best performance for each request while optimizing the quality of response and cost. This is particularly useful for applications such as customer service assistants, where uncomplicated queries can be handled by smaller, faster, and more cost-effective models, and complex queries are routed to more capable models. Intelligent Prompt Routing can reduce costs by up to 30 percent without compromising on accuracy.
